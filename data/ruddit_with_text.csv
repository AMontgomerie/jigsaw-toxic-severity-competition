So while I disagree with them and personally think they spend too much time sensationalising these events for viewers and ratings, I understand why they do it and think they are right to do what they need to stay relevant and in profit.

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

Spanking a kid doesn't tell a kid *why* not to engage in a behavior; it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior, which might temporarily fix the problem, but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong, model correct behavior, reward for good behavior, and discipline them properly only if it continues, then that will correct it in their head.

Importantly, there will be plenty of people of both genders telling that fat chick that her curves are beautiful and don't ever change etc. She will have far more success with the opposite gender than a similarly unattractive man. The fat chick will identify as a fat chick and be proud of it.

The marketing campaigns appeal to those people. The women who get sick of seeing skinny models, they see the ""real women have curves"" stuff and go ""fuck yeah, that's what I'm about"".

there is not a lot of crossover.  there is a small subset of women who want men significantly taller than they are.  if they are able to get it, it's because they bring something extra to the table themselves (out of your league).  if they can't, they'll eventually have to settle.

I've noticed lately, that when I wear muscle shirts or just roll up my sleeves, I catch the eyes of one of my female co-workers and it gives me a huge confidence boost.

I've not yet watched it, probably won't get to till tomorrow. I don't want to pass too much judgement before watching but I fear that getting two new owners backed by Angels/VC and my friend /u/esportslaw who represent teams might not have the most objective stance?

3yjsqx,cye10ac,"I had that worry as well, but it's somewhat clear early on that the three do represent a spectrum of opinions.

Noah is almost wholeheartedly for releasing the salaries, probably at least in part because Immortals is a new VC-backed company. For Noah, it's better this than nothing and it seems like nothing is the only alternative.

Bryce also clearly favors the publicized player salaries, but is approaching it from a practical/experienced look. The salary information is only a drop in the bucket of information that players really need to properly evaluate themselves.

Marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed, non-contextual, and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information.

The balanced opinions actually work pretty well. It's especially interesting seeing how different Marty and Noah's opinions are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgaLP8IM3ow/cye10ac/,-0.042

The MSR7 don't isolate that well in loud environments.  The 1A would be better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass.

The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 wouldn't have enough bass if you're worried about bass on the MSR7.

I've had a lot of portables and I think the 1A may be best for you, especially considering reasonable Japan prices.  The Momentums are really laid back up top, the the m50x are more v-shaped that the 1A.

Noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic. The two waves cancel each other.

Of course it does. Fallen has won alot more because he played in a way better team meanwhile k0nfig has played in a team much worse and therefore lost alot more resulting in a lower rating. 

> fallen was a better entry

oh please, k0nfig is much better as a pure entry. Fallens opening kill stats are better because he is an awper and awpers usually tends to have a higher opening kill stats.

its alot easier to be more consistent when you are playing in the #1 team with two top5 players in it compared to k0nfig playing in North while being a very aggressive player

Same goes for Karrigan. He is playing in a team with 4 incredible players. His role isn't to get loads of kills or anything. His role is to lead and get his insane superstars into favorable positions.

Winning is about team performance. If your team isn't good you will still lose more than you win even if you are one of the most skilled players. You can be an insane player and lose.

Winning isn't an issue but it still means you are very likely to die less, have less ecos where yout chances of fragging are low, get more eco kills etc. Having good stats in a game you win, often even very clearly, is going to be a lot easier than when you are losing.

At first it was a bunch of fuss about ""Mercury"", but what's in(or used to be in) vaccines is thimerosal which contains ethylmercury, which is natural (to use their words) and deemed safe. Methylmercury, the Mercury they're thinking of, isn't found in vaccines, but either way you can find a higher dose in fish or other foods.

Anyways that's all to say that they decided to reduce or eliminate ethylmercury just to shut people but but their still fussing about something that isn't even in most vaccines. So they did listen and make it ""safer"".",https://i.redd.it/x1x0l0zoa1x21.jpg/emvz9ip/,-0.104

Hamas has (by and large) accepted the international consensus for peace. A two state solution based on the 1967 borders. Israel refuses this international consensus. Israel is the one that doesn't want peace. Israel is the one that most regularly breaks the cease-fires. Israel is almost always the aggressor. 

> We should just nuke the entire area and make it uninhabitable for everyone. Neither culture is important or with saving.
