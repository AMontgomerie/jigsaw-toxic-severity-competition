280,To be honest I don't even remember. ,"> Because once a biological woman has undergone sex change or transitioned, they are then a male.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

But it also depends on your culture. The norm in some cultures require the guest to first refuse several times before finally giving in and accepting. The host is expected to continue to offer and attempt to convince the guest until they accept. The guest in these situations often wants to drink, but must be polite and first refuse. This is especially true if the guest is a woman. It would be seen as rude or stingy for the host not to ask the guest several times if they would want a drink.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

I would strongly encourage you to educate yourself more on this issue, because you'll draw a lot of false conclusions if you don't understand the nature of how sex/gender really behaves scientifically as well as socially/culturally.

I didn't think I had to. I don't have to do anything. It was still ultimately my choice. I enjoy myself with my friends in many different contexts. I allowed myself to be convinced to change up the context, and it led to a great night. 

> If we broke down the details, we would likely find that the reasons you enjoyed yourself were quite separate from the fact that you drank a depressant that filled your senses and slowed your brain.

Actually, no. I definitely enjoyed myself more because the drinks helped me to relax, get a good buzz going, and feel more social energy/ reduced anxiety. That's why so many people like to drink.

However I urge you to consider the motive behind incarceration as it occurs in the US and many other countries now. As I see it there are 4 main motives:

1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

3) Deterrent

4) Protection of ""normal"" citizens.

I would argue that if you look at the outcome (high sentences, strong chance of actually getting worse in prison, sexual violence, overcrowding, etc.) you would conclude the obvious motive almost entirely number 4.

This can actually be proof that that God doesn't exist. I can prove this through the sheer power of numbers. Greatest implies a sense of quantity.

Anything that is quantifiable, I can conceive of something larger than what actually exists, just by adding 1 to it.

So, if we're arguing that God, I can say that any being will fall short of that because of the nature of infinities and the infinite number of infinities and some infinities being larger than other infinities.","When Tim Tebow was kneeling in prayer, not during the anthem, just during the game, every one is up and arms about ""don't put your religious stuff on me.""

There is nothing about the NFL that insinuates they have any interest in upholding free speech. They don't want to lose money by pissing off conservative viewers? It doesn't violate any of their principles to discourage players from doing things that piss them off. Even beyond any of either corporation's stated aims, I think it makes a lot more sense to expect some level from free speech from Twitter than the NFL."
1922,"Such hyped, much delayed -_-","This sounds great in theory, but in practice it's not always like this. There are probably rules like that in most states, but the definition of providing value to the company is pretty fuzzy, and employers take advantage of students or other young people that need to get experience to land a job that pays well.

I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the OP, but at the very least I think the rules should be more strict when it comes to determining what can constitute a paid vs. unpaid internship (and the same the goes for exempt vs. non-exempt workers)."

As I said... I'm not too sure. That's why I am discussing alimony. That is, a continuous payment from one party to the other. For other cases, it's very dependent.

Imagine a person who saved money for ten years to buy a house. The day before the buy, they marry. The buy has been done only through that person's hard work and saving, but as there was a 1day marriage, it is now owned by both? And if that second person decides to leave for no good reason, that person get half a cut? That hardly seems fair.

Earmarks used to be the way to get reluctant lawmakers on board. Since they've been done away with there is nothing you can give someone in that situation and the only politically smart thing to do for legislators in swingy districts or with strong primary challengers is to say no to any such legislation.

If you are interested in changing your view, I'd recommend seeking out hard data on the topic.

Their is no reason why people shouldn't be vaccinated, especially if it we're free.

As it stands today I 100% am behind jailing parents who are the cause of others children who die due to their unvaccinated kids.

That said, there's always prosecutorial discretion. If it seems obvious that two siblings have had sex and there's been no grooming or anything like that, a prosecutor could just choose not to press charges.

But it also depends on your culture. The norm in some cultures require the guest to first refuse several times before finally giving in and accepting. The host is expected to continue to offer and attempt to convince the guest until they accept. The guest in these situations often wants to drink, but must be polite and first refuse. This is especially true if the guest is a woman. It would be seen as rude or stingy for the host not to ask the guest several times if they would want a drink.

So what you see as pestering is, for the host, a social/cultural obligation."

Some people want everything to belong to one race or another. For example I saw latina women mad because women of other races were wearing hoop earrings. Earrings!!! Things like that are not cultural appropriation. Its not cultural. 
Something that is appropriation is using religious symbols as fashion. Or taking something and lessoning its value. For example, bindis. They are a religious piece of great importance they aren’t a part of fashion. 
I feel like for it to be appropriation the value or perceived value has to be changed. Earrings mean as much to a black person as the do to a white person. A traditional headdress means something of deep value. Someone who isnt native wearing cheapens its value and makes it seem worthless

To her, gender is merely a biological/physical circumstance and in no way inhibits her ability to succeed. She never ceases to amaze me and I have no doubts that if she wanted to, she could be president.
